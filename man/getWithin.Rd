  Within-class Covariance Matrix
}
\description{
  Calculates the estimated within-class covariance matrix
}
\usage{
getWithin(variables, group)
}
\arguments{
  \item{variables}{matrix or data frame with explanatory variables (No missing values are allowed)}
  \item{group}{vector or factor with group memberships (No missing values are allowed)}
}
\details{
  The obtained matrix is the estimated within-class covariance matrix (i.e. within-class covariance matrix divided by its degrees of freedom \code{n-k}, where \code{n} is the number of observations and \code{k} is the number of groups)
